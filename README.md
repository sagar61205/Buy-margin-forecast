# Buy-margin forecasting

## Business problem statement:

1. Determine whether there are detectable trends in Buy-Margin values at a supplier or overall level over a 10 year period.

2. Build forecast models to predict Buy Margin percentages for the year 2022-2023.

# Features:
1.	Month Year - Shows the month and year for sales, wholesale and aquisition cost, and buy-margin for multiple parent pharmaceutical suppliers.
2.	Parent supplier number - Shows the corresponding parent suplier supplier number associated with each supplier
3.	Buy-margin raw dollar - Shows the original buy-margin amount prior to grouping with wholesale and aquisition cost and sales for each supplier
4.	WAC: Shows the total wholesale and aquisition cost of all drugs/medicines for each supplier
5.	Sales: Shows the total amount of sales of all drugs/medicines by each supplier
 
These are the major factors affecting the buy-margin value. Additonally, all the values are grouped with sales and parent suppliers number for 
a complete analysis of buy-margin value trend, seasonality, variability for parent supplier based on total sales.

## We helped the client by:

<UL><li>Identifying trends and seasonality in the overall supplier data in comparison with the top 3 suppliers

<li>Forecast models produced for the top 3 suppliers as well as an overall model for all suppliers

<li>Analyzed long-term trends, behaviors, variability, distributions and transformations of top 3 individual suppliers along with the overall model and 
their impact on the future forecast</ul>

## Creating meaningful impact:

<ul><li>Created a forecasting model by minimizing the error rate from a 7%-8% range to a range of 2%-4% as per MAE and RMSE for the top 3 suppliers and the overall model.
<li>Created a report with crucial insights and takeaways for top suppliers in terms of trends, seasonality, variability and forecast accuracy for critical future business decisions. 



This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the organization. So, please don't use it for making forecasting decsions. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use Machine learning time-series forecasting into practice and how much ipact we can generate from the same.

## MOTIVATION üí™
Air industry is extremely prone to accident and there are various factors responsible such as limited and complicated airspace, visibity etc. This project was created keeping that in mind. This is an application which should just be used by air traffic controllers in any way but a way show the working of an end to end ML project for the domain.

In this project, I present a website in which the predictions are implemented as; Batch File PRediction(which predicts and generates a new file with predicted values based in the pre-trained model. 
For the visibility predicting application, the user can input the data and the application will predict the number of visibility for air traffic.
